	  For this project, the program takes a user’s initial deposit, a monthly deposit, an interest rate, and the number of years the customer would like to see information about. It then displays two menus to the customer. One menu shows the customer the amount of interest earned on their initial deposit and the amount at the end of that year WITHOUT a monthly deposit. The second menu displays the same, but includes a monthly deposit entered by the user. It is supposed to calculate this for as many years as the customer requests.
                                                      # What did you do particularly well?
                                                       
	  In this project, I felt that I was very descriptive about what the code is doing. I also feel that it is very organized and easy to read for anyone else who may need to change or reference it.
  
                  # Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
                 
	  There are definitely many areas that could be better concerning this program. First, I was not able to get the program to calculate the interest or yearly total past one year. I know there is a simple solution to this using a loop, I just need to spend more time working the logic out. Another issue I had was determining where to use a class, instead of simply using functions. Because of this, I was not able to separate the program into individual files. This also kept me from creating public, protected, and private variables, which in turn caused this program to lack any security.
    
   # Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
      
	  Probably the hardest part was determining where a class would be useful instead of functions in a smaller program such as this. In order to overcome this obstacle and get the program running, I only used functions and “main”. Since then, I have read a bunch of content on C++ classes and watched a C++ tutorial in order to get a better understanding of these concepts.
    
                           # What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
                            
	  This is the third language I have begun to learn and so far every class has built upon the others, despite the many differences of each language. Just learning the C++ structure and syntax will be extremely useful in future classes. Although this was a challenging class, I am walking away with a much broader understanding of programming in general.
  
                                         # How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
                                          
	  In order to be adaptable at my skill level, my code is lacking in complexity. But, it is extremely readable and easy to follow. The comments are straightforward and simple. I have used the appropriate white spacing throughout in order for the code to be understood easily, which keeps it maintainable as well.
